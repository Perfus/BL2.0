Code for data processing for "An improved pathway for autonomous bioluminescence imaging in eukaryotes" paper

Custom code was deposited. Since its modular system and similar pipeline in several data processing in some cases code was provided as modules, which were combined to process different datasets. Also, different files may have different names and sets of columns, therefore the code responsible for reading such files will differ slightly.
